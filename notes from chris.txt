decision choices is redundant - keep decisions
inefficient grid search methods that require a large number of points -- mistifying to theorists
say instead - solved using methods that try to achieve multiple goals simultaneously
time intensive -- are slow
too many words --- 100 words or less
separating problems is generic -- say instead that the requirements for a problem to be solved using EGM and GPR provide guidance about how to
transform a simultaneous problem into sequential problems that can be solved efficiently -- this tells you how to break it down
Second is restating EGM -- either readers already understand or not... Second can be eliminated
Curvilinear is unknown, don't expect reader to know meaning of it.. focus on structured vs unstructured
The special sauce is GPR complements sharp points of EGM -> say one of tricky things of EGM is non-linearities introduced into the constructed functions
and judicious choice of interpolation method can make a big difference in efficiently handling the non-linear structure of the things that are pushed out
by EGM... special recipee to be used by what comes out of EGM
instead of Applied sequentially -- Exercises in the paper demonstrate the degree of speed up which can be quantified.. #todo
Combine second to last 2 sentences -- The paper goes through a set of examples of real world problems that illustrate how the tools can be applied in different contexts
