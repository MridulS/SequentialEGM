  This paper describes a method for solving heterogeneous agent models
  with many decision choices. It extends the method proposed by (G2EGM)
  and
  complements recent work by (NEGM) on how to nest such models. I suggest
  first
  solving the pure consumption problem (inner loop) using a standard EGM
  step.
  Then, the outer loop is solved using an appropriately designed
  sequential EGM
  step. Finally, I used the method for curvilinear or "wraped grid"
  interpolation
  as in White (2015).

  ---

  Heterogeneous agent models with many decision choices are often solved using inefficient
  grid search methods that require a large number of points and are often very slow.
  This paper provides a method for solving such models using a novel extension of the
  endogenous grid method (EGM) that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to interpolate
  functions on unstructured grids. First, separating models into smaller, sequential problems
  allows for more tractable and digestable problems. Second, using an exogenous grid of
  post-decision states and solving for an endogenous grid of pre-decision states that obey
  a first order condition greatly speeds up the solution process. Third, as the resulting
  endogenous grid can often be curvilinear at best and unstructured at worst, GPR provides
  an efficient and accurate method for interpolating value, marginal value, and policy functions.
  Applied sequentially to each smaller problem, the method is able to solve heterogeneous agent
  models with many decision choices in a fraction of the time required by standard grid search methods.
  The method is applied to a number of increasingly complex models for demonstration purposes.
  Software is provided in the form of a Python module under the `HARK` package.
