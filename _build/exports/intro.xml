        <title>Background</title>
        <p>Macroeconomic modeling aims to describe a complex world of agents interacting with each other and making decisions in a dynamic setting. The models are often very complex, require strong underlying assumptions, and use a lot of computational power to solve. One of the most common methods to solve these complex problems is using a grid search method to solve the model. The Endogenous Grid Method (EGM) developed by
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="Carroll2006">Carroll (2006)</xref> allows dynamic optimization problems to be solved in a more computationally efficient and faster manner than the previous method of convex optimization using grid search. Many problems that before took hours to compute became much easier to solve and allowed macroeconomists and computational economists to focus on estimation and simulation.
        </p>
        <p>However, the Endogenous Grid Method is limited to a few specific classes of problems. Recently, the classes of problems to which EGM can be applied have been expanded

        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="Carroll2006">Carroll (2006)</xref> first introduced the Endogenous Grid Method as a way to speed up the solution of dynamic stochastic consumption-savings problems. The method consists of starting with an exogenous grid of post-decision states and using the inverse of the first-order condition to find the optimal consumption policy that rationalizes such post-decision states. Given the optimal policy and post-decision states, it is straightforward to calculate the initial pre-decision state that leads to the optimal policy. Although this method is certainly innovative, it only applied to a model with one control variable and one state variable.
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="Barillas2007">Barillas &amp; Fernández-Villaverde (2007)</xref> further extend this method by including more than one control variable in the form of a labor-leisure choice, as well as a second state variable for stochastic persistence.

      <p>The purpose of this paper is to describe a new method for solving dynamic optimization problems efficiently and accurately while avoiding convex optimization and grid search methods with the use of the Endogenous Grid Method and first-order conditions. The method is called Sequential EGM (or EGM

      <title>Methodology</title>
      <p>The sequential Endogenous Grid Method consists of 3 major parts: First, the problem to be solved should be broken up into a sequence of smaller problems that themselves don’t add any additional state variables or introduce asynchronous dynamics with respect to the uncertainty. If the problem is broken up in such a way that uncertainty can happen in more than one period, then the solution to this sequence of problems might be different from the aggregate problem due to giving the agent additional information about the future by realizing some uncertainty. Second, I evaluate each of the smaller problems to see if they can be solved using the Endogenous Grid Method. This evaluation is of greater scope than the traditional Endogenous Grid Method, as it allows for the resulting exogenous grid to be non-regular. If the subproblem can not be solved with EGM, then convex optimization is used. Third, if the exogenous grid generated by the EGM is non-regular, then I use a multidimensional interpolation method that takes advantage of machine learning tools to generate an interpolating function. Solving each subproblem in this way, the sequential Endogenous Grid Method is capable of solving complex problems that are not solvable with the traditional Endogenous Grid Method and are difficult and time-consuming to solve with convex optimization and grid search methods.</p>

      <p>The Sequential Endogenous Grid Method is capable of solving multivariate dynamic optimization problems in an efficient and fast manner by avoiding grid search. This should allow researchers and practitioners to solve more complex problems that were previously not easily accessible to them, but more accurately capture the dynamics of the macroeconomy. By using advancements in machine learning techniques such as Gaussian Process Regression, the Sequential Endogenous Grid Method is capable of solving problems that were not previously able to be solved using the traditional Endogenous Grid Method. In particular, the Sequential Endogenous Grid Method is different from NEGM in that it allows for using more than one Endogenous Grid Method step to solve a problem, avoiding costly grid search methods to the extent that the problem allows.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the Sequential Endogenous Grid Method often sheds light on the problem by breaking it down into a sequence of simpler problems that were not previously apparent. This is because intermediary steps in the solution process generate value and marginal value functions of different pre- and post-decision states that can be used to understand the problem better.</p>
