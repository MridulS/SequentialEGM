Description of visiting position

My most concrete goal will be to prepare my job market paper, titled EGM^n : The Sequential Endogenous Grid Method, for submission to journals. I am particularly interested in this line of research and plan to work on related projects, such as the Fixed Point Endogenous Grid Method, and a Fast Upper Envelope for Multidimensional Discrete Choice Models. These methods allow for increased speed of solving complex multidimensional optimization problems that are critical for heterogeneous agent models. Solving more computationally intensive problems faster and more efficiently will also allow for a broader use of these methods by scholars who may not have access to high levels of computational power. Broadening the use of heterogeneous agent models and expanding the level of complexity of the types of research questions that can be addressed with these models can allow for additional insights to be gained in economics.

Beyond computational economics, I am interested in using these methods and tools to analyze the financial conditions of low income households and families. In one of my dissertation papers, I investigate how mortgage debt affects the investment decisions of households and whether this leads to lower savings and retirement outcomes. For years economic models of portfolio choice have been at odds with observed portfolio behavior by concluding that households should be investing substantially in the stock market. A particular reason for this deviation might be that households in the middle of the income distribution are liquidity constrained and overleveraged, by having equity tied up to their house and a long horizon for mortgage debt. For low income households, having to save for a downpayment further deters risky behavior associated with stock market participation and higher returns to wealth.

In a working project, I investigate how different levels of spending on children's health and education during early childhood affect their long-term economic outcomes. As research has shown, early childhood intervention is critical to human capital formation and later economic outcomes. However, early childhood is often associated with younger parents who have not had the time to build financial stability. Improving the living conditions of young and low income parents, and especially of single mothers, can have dramatic effects in their children’s economic mobility as well as physical and mental health. This important work is tied to the structural microeconomics literature of estimating factor models, as in estimating how spending on children affects their latent human capital and observed labor market outcomes as adults.

I am also interested in the effect that savings/banking institutions have on the financial wellbeing of households. Surveys have shown that a significant portion of American households are underbanked or unbanked, which can limit households' ability to save for important investments like housing or retirement. Modeling households’ banking conditions can thus shed light on the “poverty trap” and provide insights for policy recommendations in areas of public banking. The main mechanism that relates this topic to computational economics and structural microeconomics is the discrete choice of households to default on their debt or of banks to deny credit.

Lastly, I am excited to continue working with JHU faculty and students, such as Chris Carroll and Mateo Velasquez-Giraldo with whom I have collaborated in the past. I have also been lucky to meet other students at JHU such as Adrian Monninger, William Du, and Decory Edwards, with whom I’ve engaged in interesting discussions and hope to work with more in the future. I am also excited at the possibility of learning from and engaging with the excellent structural microeconomics faculty at JHU Economics. Robert Moffitt’s extensive research in anti-poverty and welfare, along with the structure of the family and wage dynamics in the US are important factors to include in heterogeneous agent macro models to analyze the changing conditions of low income households in the US. Michael Keane is an expert in discrete choice and dynamic lifecycle modeling which are rich areas in microeconomics but are just recently being embraced by macroeconomists due to complications which I hope to address with my computational research. Yujung Hwang is a junior professor who has published open source software that could be used in solving structural factor models, such as the one used in my model that studies household spending on children.


shorter version:

My primary goal is to submit my job market paper, EGM^n: The Sequential Endogenous Grid Method, to journals. I am passionate about this research and plan to work on related projects such as the Fixed Point Endogenous Grid Method and a Fast Upper Envelope for Multidimensional Discrete Choice Models. These methods will enable faster and more efficient solving of complex multidimensional optimization problems, which is crucial for heterogeneous agent models and can lead to important insights in the economics of household finances.

In addition to computational economics, I am interested in using these methods and tools to analyze the financial situations of low-income households and families. In my dissertation, I investigate how mortgage debt affects households' investment decisions and savings for retirement. Economic models of portfolio choice have long been at odds with observed stock market participation, particularly for middle-income households who may be liquidity constrained and overleveraged due to equity tied up in their homes and long-term mortgage debt. For low-income households, saving for a downpayment further discourages risky behavior associated with stock market participation and higher returns on wealth.

I also study the impact of early childhood spending on long-term economic outcomes, particularly for low-income families. Early childhood intervention is crucial for human capital development and future economic success. Improving the living conditions of young and low-income parents, particularly single mothers, can significantly enhance their children's economic mobility, as well as their physical and mental health. This work is closely linked to the structural microeconomics literature, which estimates factor models to determine how investing in children affects their latent human capital and observed labor market outcomes as adults.

Additionally, I am interested in the impact of savings and banking institutions on households' financial wellbeing. Many American households are underbanked or unbanked, which can hinder their ability to save for significant investments such as housing or retirement. By modeling households' banking conditions, we can better understand the "poverty trap" and make policy recommendations in areas such as public banking. The discrete choice of households to default on their debt or banks to deny credit is the primary mechanism that connects this topic to computational economics and structural microeconomics.

Lastly, I am thrilled to continue collaborating with JHU faculty and students, including Chris Carroll and Mateo Velasquez-Giraldo. Additionally, I look forward to working with Adrian Monninger, William Du, and Decory Edwards in the future. Finally, I am excited about the opportunity to learn from and engage with the exceptional structural microeconomics faculty at JHU Economics, such as Robert Moffitt, Michael Keane, and Yujung Hwang, whose expertise in anti-poverty and welfare, discrete choice and dynamic lifecycle modeling, and factor model estimation can greatly benefit my computational research on household spending and low-income households in the US.

My primary goal is to submit my job market paper, EGM^n, and related projects to journals. These methods enable faster solving of complex optimization problems for heterogeneous agent models. I am also interested in analyzing the financial conditions of low-income households and families, examining the impact of household spending on children's long-term economic outcomes, and modeling households' banking conditions to better understand the "poverty trap."
