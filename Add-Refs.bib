  abstract  = {We develop an envelope condition method (ECM) for dynamic
               programming problems -- a tractable alternative to expensive
               conventional value function iteration (VFI). ECM has two novel
               features: first, to reduce the cost of iteration on Bellman
               equation, ECM constructs policy functions using envelope
               conditions which are simpler to analyze numerically than
               first-order conditions. Second, to increase the accuracy of
               solutions, ECM solves for derivatives of value function jointly
               with value function itself. We complement ECM with other
               computational techniques that are suitable for high-dimensional
               problems, such as simulation-based grids, monomial integration
               rules and derivative-free solvers. The resulting value-iterative
               ECM method can accurately solve models with at least up to 20
               state variables and can successfully compete in accuracy and
               speed with state-of-the-art Euler equation methods. We also use
               ECM to solve a challenging default risk model with a kink in
               value and policy functions.},

               tools to speed up the solution of such models. Firstly, I use
               that many consumption models have a nesting structure implying

               the consumption choice solved separately before the remaining

               the consumption choice. Thirdly, I use that the required

               economic models with a finite, large number of continuous state
               variables. (Examples of such models are new Keynesian models,
               life-cycle models, heterogeneous-agents models, asset-pricing
               models, multisector models, multicountry models, and climate
               change models.) First, we describe the ingredients that help us
               to reduce the cost of global solution methods. These are
               efficient nonproduct techniques for interpolating and
               approximating functions (Smolyak, stochastic simulation, and
               $\epsilon$-distinguishable set grids), accurate low-cost
               monomial integration formulas, derivative-free solvers, and
               numerically stable regression methods. Second, we discuss
               endogenous grid and envelope condition methods that reduce the
               cost and increase accuracy of value function iteration. Third,
               we show precomputation techniques that construct solution
               manifolds for some models' variables outside the main iterative
               cycle. Fourth, we review techniques that increase the accuracy
               of perturbation methods: a change of variables and a hybrid of
               local and global solutions. Finally, we show examples of
               parallel computation using multiple CPUs and GPUs including
               applications on a supercomputer. We illustrate the performance

               perform uncertainty quantification, in a single model

               a parallelized discrete-time dynamic programming algorithm. To
               demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we compute
               solutions to stochastic optimal growth models of up to 500
               continuous dimensions. We also show that our framework can
