  abstract  = {We develop an envelope condition method (ECM) for dynamic
               programming problems -- a tractable alternative to expensive
               conventional value function iteration (VFI). ECM has two novel
               features: first, to reduce the cost of iteration on Bellman
               equation, ECM constructs policy functions using envelope
               conditions which are simpler to analyze numerically than
               first-order conditions. Second, to increase the accuracy of
               solutions, ECM solves for derivatives of value function jointly
               with value function itself. We complement ECM with other
               computational techniques that are suitable for high-dimensional
               problems, such as simulation-based grids, monomial integration
               rules and derivative-free solvers. The resulting value-iterative
               ECM method can accurately solve models with at least up to 20
               state variables and can successfully compete in accuracy and
               speed with state-of-the-art Euler equation methods. We also use
               ECM to solve a challenging default risk model with a kink in
               value and policy functions.},

               choices are typically hard to solve numerically due to the
               presence of non-convexities. This paper provides a number of
               tools to speed up the solution of such models. Firstly, I use
               that many consumption models have a nesting structure implying
               that the continuation value can be efficiently pre-computed and
               the consumption choice solved separately before the remaining
               choices. Secondly, I use that an endogenous grid method extended
               with an upper envelope step can be used to solve efficiently for
               the consumption choice. Thirdly, I use that the required
               pre-computations can be optimized by a novel loop reordering
               when interpolating the next-period value function. As an
               illustrative example, I solve a model with non-durable
               consumption and durable consumption subject to adjustment costs.
               Combining the provided tools, the model is solved almost 50

               91(3):312--320, 2006) to higher dimensions with more than one
               continuous endogenous state variable. We compare three different
               categories of algorithms: (i) the conventional method with
               exogenous grids (EXOGM), (ii) the pure method of endogenous
               gridpoints (ENDGM) and (iii) a hybrid method (HYBGM). ENDGM
               comes along with Delaunay interpolation on irregular grids.
               Comparison of methods is done by evaluating speed and accuracy
               by using a specific model with two endogenous state variables.
               We find that HYBGM and ENDGM both dominate EXOGM. In an infinite
               horizon model, ENDGM also always dominates HYBGM. In a finite
               horizon model, the choice between HYBGM and ENDGM depends on the

               gridpoints in each dimension ENDGM is faster than HYBGM, and
               vice versa. For a standard choice of 25--50 gridpoints in each
               dimension, ENDGM is 1.4--1.7 times faster than HYBGM in the
               finite horizon version and 2.4--2.5 times faster in the infinite

  abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability
              or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library
              that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was
              designed from first principles to support an imperative and
              Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes
              debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific
              computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting
              hardware accelerators such as GPUs. In this paper, we detail the
              principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they
              are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect
              of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of
              its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic
              implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them
              to work together to achieve compelling performance. We
              demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as
              the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.},

  abstract  = {We present a novel computational framework that can compute
               global solutions to high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic
               models on irregular state space geometries. This framework can
               also resolve value and policy functions' local features and
               perform uncertainty quantification, in a single model
               evaluation. We achieve this by combining Gaussian process
               machine learning with active subspaces; we then embed this into
               a parallelized discrete-time dynamic programming algorithm. To
               demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we compute
               solutions to stochastic optimal growth models of up to 500
               continuous dimensions. We also show that our framework can
               address parameter uncertainty and can provide predictive
               confidence intervals for policies that correspond to the
               epistemic uncertainty induced by limited data. Finally, we
               propose an algorithm that, based on combining this framework
               with Bayesian Gaussian mixture models, is capable of learning
               irregularly shaped ergodic sets as well as performing dynamic
               programming on them.},

               computations of expected outcomes while searching for optimal
               policy functions. I provide an interpolation technique for
               non-rectilinear grids that allow ENDG to be used in
               n-dimensional problems in an intuitive and computationally
               efficient way: the acceleration of ENDG with non-linear grid
               interpolation is nearly constant in the density of the grid.
               Further, ENDG has only been shown by example and has never been
               formally characterized. Using a theoretical framework for
               dynamic stochastic optimization problems, I formalize the method
               of endogenous gridpoints and present conditions for the class of
               models for which it can be used.},
